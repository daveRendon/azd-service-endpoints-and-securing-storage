### 1. What Resources are getting deployed

#### Scenario
You have been asked to create a proof of concept to demonstrate securing Azure file shares. Specifically, you want to:

Create a storage endpoint so traffic destined to Azure Storage always stays within the Azure backbone network.
Configure the storage endpoint so only resources from a specific subnet can access the storage.
Confirm that resources outside of the specific subnet cannot access the storage.

Resources deployed: 

 - myVMPrivate_OsDisk_1 and 2: VM disks
 - myVmPublic_OsDisk_1 and 2: VM disks
 - MyVM1NiC and MyVM2Nic: network interfaces
 - myNsgPrivate and MyNsgPublic: Network security groups
 - MyVmPrivate-ip: Private IP address
 - MyVmPublic-ip: Public IP Address
 - storage-rgname: storage account
 - MyVmPublic and MyVmPrivate: Virtual machines
 - myVirtualNetwork: virtual  network

### 2. What can I demo from this scenario after deployment

This demo guides you through a hands-on exercise to build and secure a networked environment in Azure. You will start by creating a virtual network and adding a subnet with a configured storage endpoint. Next, you will implement network security groupsâ€”first to restrict access to the private subnet and then to allow RDP access on the public subnet. Following this, you will create a storage account with a file share and deploy virtual machines into their respective subnets. Finally, you will test the storage connection from both the private and public subnets to verify that access is correctly allowed from the private subnet and denied from the public subnet.
